== AboutMe App

As a Dev Boot in Fall 2012 I have the task to build up an About Me page. So I thought it would be a good idea not only to show that I can build up a HTML/CSS page but also practice the structure of Rails and Bootstrap, and I wanted to try things I recently learned, like using Microformats.
